This is the top-\/level repository for the \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp}{\texttt{ SynaesthetiQ}} project. \mbox{\hyperlink{classSynaesthetiQ}{SynaesthetiQ}} is a music visualiser prototype using envelope following, frequency analysis and genre detection to create engaging visualisations of music in real-\/time. This project was started as part of a Real-\/time Embedded Programming undergraduate project at the University of Glasgow.

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{One Repo to Rule Them All}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This repository is called the \textquotesingle{}Puppet\+Master\textquotesingle{} because it\textquotesingle{}s main function is to link together other repositories, each containing different submodules of the full \mbox{\hyperlink{classSynaesthetiQ}{SynaesthetiQ}} processing flow. These submodules are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp/SynaesthetiQ-audiocapture}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Audio Capture}}}} -\/ Handles data acquisition, frequency analysis and genre classification.
\item \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp/envelope_following}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Envelope Following}}}} -\/ A simple envelope follower to visualise the pulse of music.
\item \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp/SynaesthetiQ-LED-LIbrary}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{LED Library}}}} -\/ Renders visualisations to an array of LEDs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The relationships between these submodules are handled by the \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp/SynaesthetiQ-PuppetMaster/tree/main/src/Visualiser}{\texttt{ Visualiser}}, which is defined within this repository.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Data Flow}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The overall flow of data through these submodules can be representatd by this diagram\+:

  

More information on how these submodules work and interact with each other can be found in their respective repositories and the \mbox{[}documentation\mbox{]}() for this project.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Hardware}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
A new \href{https://github.com/rt5-tp/Synaesthetiq-Hardware-Design}{\texttt{ hardware}} prototype was designed and built to demonstrate the functionality of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classSynaesthetiQ}{SynaesthetiQ}} software. It centre\textquotesingle{}s around a pair of flexible LED Matrices which have been wrapped around a 3D printed core, placed on top of this core is another larger LED. The big LED is designed to provide a simple envelope following function, where the brightness is proportional to the intensity of sound at that moment, while the matrix should provide a more complex frequency-\/domain visualisation. This allows for a combination of unique musical visualisation and bright impactful lighting.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
